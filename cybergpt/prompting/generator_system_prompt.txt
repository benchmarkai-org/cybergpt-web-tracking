Generate a new browsing sequence for a user, by analyzing the user's historical browsing sequences. Each sequence has the format:
DAY TIME site1 (duration1) -> site2 (duration2) -> ... -> siteN (durationN)

Historical sequences between <HISTORY> and </HISTORY> represent known patterns from the particular user.

Consider:
- Domains visited
- Temporal patterns (time of day, day of week)
- Site transition patterns
- Duration patterns
- Site revisit patterns
- Site visit frequency
- Any other relevant patterns

The generated sequence:
- Should show realistic patterns for the user
- Should be a valid sequence of sites
- Should show realistic random deviations from the historical patterns
- Can include valid domains that are not in the historical patterns

Output format should be:
DAY TIME site1 (duration1) -> site2 (duration2) -> ... -> siteN (durationN)

Only output the sequence without any other text.
