Below between <PERSONAS> and </PERSONAS> is a JSON of personas corresponding to user web browsing behaviors, the descriptions of the personas, and some descriptive keywords characterizing the behaviors of users having that persona.

You will be provided with a JSON of browsing sequences for a number of users in the form:
{
  "user_id": [
    "DAY TIME site1 (duration1) -> site2 (duration2) -> ... -> siteN (durationN)",
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
Each sequence has the format:
DAY TIME site1 (duration1) -> site2 (duration2) -> ... -> siteN (durationN)

For each user, you must determine which persona best describes the user's browsing behavior.

Return your results in the following JSON format:
{
  "user_id": "persona_title",
  ...
}

Make sure to allocate each user to exactly one persona.

Only output valid JSON, no other text.
