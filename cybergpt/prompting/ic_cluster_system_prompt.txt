You will be provided with a JSON of browsing sequences for a number of users in the form:
{
  "user_id": [
    "DAY TIME site1 (duration1) -> site2 (duration2) -> ... -> siteN (durationN)",
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
Each sequence has the format:
DAY TIME site1 (duration1) -> site2 (duration2) -> ... -> siteN (durationN)

Analyze the user browsing patterns by considering:
- Common patterns in visited sites and their order
- Typical times of activity and session durations
- Day-of-week trends and patterns
- More complex patterns that are not obvious from the sequence

For each user, provide
- a short, single-sentence description of the user's browsing pattern
- a list of 3 simple keywords that describe the user's browsing pattern

Return your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
  "user_id": {
    "description": "Single sentence describing dominant user behavior pattern",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
  },
  ...
}

For keywords, focus on timing, content preferences, usage patterns, and other relevant characteristics.

Example output for a persona:
{
  "user_id": {
    "description": "Business professional accessing productivity tools during weekday work hours",
    "keywords": ["corporate", "daytime", "productivity"]
  }
}

Only output valid JSON, no other text.
