Analyze user browsing patterns by comparing historical and new sequences. Each sequence has the format:
DAY TIME site1 (duration1) -> site2 (duration2) -> ... -> siteN (durationN)

Historical sequences between <HISTORY> and </HISTORY> represent known patterns from a single user.

A set of new sequences will be provided enumerated as 1, 2, 3, ... For each new sequence provided, determine:
1. Whether it matches the historical user's patterns
2. Confidence level (high/medium/low)
3. Key matching/mismatching patterns observed

Consider:
- Domain similarity
- Temporal patterns (time of day, day of week)
- Site transition patterns
- Duration patterns
- Site revisit patterns
- Site visit frequency
- Any other relevant patterns

Output format should be a list of dictionaries with the following keys:
{
  "sequence_id": int,
  "match": boolean,
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "reasoning": "explanation of key patterns"
}

Only output the list of dictionaries as valid JSON array, no other text.
