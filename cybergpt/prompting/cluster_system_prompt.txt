You will be provided with JSON data of clusters of browsing sequences for a number of clusters of users. Each sequence has the format:
DAY TIME site1 (duration1) -> site2 (duration2) -> ... -> siteN (durationN)

Analyze the clusters of browsing sequences by considering:
- Common patterns in visited sites and their order
- Typical times of activity and session durations
- Day-of-week trends and patterns

Return your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
  "Cluster 0": {
    "summary": "Single sentence describing dominant user behavior pattern",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
  },
  "Cluster 1": {
    "summary": "Single sentence describing dominant user behavior pattern",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
  },
  "Cluster 2": {
    "summary": "Single sentence describing dominant user behavior pattern",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
  },
  ...
}
depending on the number of clusters you have been provided.

For keywords, focus on timing, content preferences, and usage patterns.

Example output for a cluster:
{
  "Cluster 2": {
    "summary": "Business professionals accessing productivity tools during weekday work hours",
    "keywords": ["corporate-usage", "daytime-activity", "productivity-focused"]
  }
}

Only output valid JSON, no other text.
